◊headline{What story will we tell?}

◊lead{Together, we're creating an epic tale. It's travelling the
world, passed from writer to writer, growing and evolving at each
step.}

◊p{It all starts with a simple notebook. One person writes part of a
story in it, then mails it to their successor - creating a chain of
authorship in which each writer builds on the work of all the people
before them. At the end, we'll have a shared story that we created
together, and we'll share it here with the world.}

of the first to know when the story is available for you to read!}
